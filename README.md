**THIS PROJECT IS WORK IN PROGRESS. IT IS NOT YET COMPLETED.**

This is a project created by Daniel Mar for an AI battle. 

It is designed based on American Checkers rules, and alternates between player and AI turns. It is to be a template for a programmer to add their own AI to the game and thus "fight" the player (when completed). 

The program can be run by opening index.html.

The player has their mandatory moves highlighted, and if there are no mandatory moves, their available moves are highlighted.

##To-do
- [x] add ability for player to move mandatory moves
- [x] highlight available moves when no mandatory moves
- [x] add ability for player to move available moves
- [x] add capturing
- [ ] add turning into kings
